# Verilog-RISCV-Processor
A custom-designed 32-bit single-cycle processor based on the RV32I instruction set architecture (ISA), implemented in Verilog. This processor executes one instruction per clock cycle and supports a broad subset of RISC-V base instructions, including arithmetic, logical, shift, memory access, and control flow operations.
